        <div class="subheading mb-5">Artist/Studio Art Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am Giselle Vargas! Currently, I am a first-year university student majoring in Studio Art. I am not just your average student; I am a first-gen college student with an excellent student background. Coming from a low socioeconomic background, I have always been inspired to find the best in tough situations and strive for success. I am the oldest of 3 siblings, and I make it a responsibility to be a great role model. After all of my efforts, I can say that the many people in my life (family, friends, and mentors) are proud of me and continue to support me in my journey ahead.<br><br>

        I want to say that I've always been an artist. Ever since I can remember, I have always liked to draw and color. Even if it is considered a basic activity for children, that right there was the early marks of what I wanted to do in the future, well not exactly. At first I wanted to be a fashion designer, and then a chemist (crazy right). It wasn't until 7th grade where I really was starting to reflect on my future. I have always been someone who had many interest and can do well in various fields, but I didn't really know what I wanted to do. After pondering, I realized I needed to flip the question; what was it that I wanted to accomplish in my life. In all honesty, I really wanted to move people's hearts. I wanted to be someone that can share emotions, memories, and experiences with others and connect the world better. Yeah you can do that with literature or music, but I found that art is something that fits my style more. Specifically, I gravitated more towards animation. Animation is a form of art where people can look and see what the message is. You have multiple artists working together from various fields (writers, artists, composers, filmmakers, etc.) to create a project for others to enjoy and take away something. I really want to achieve that feeling of knowing someone carried what many wanted to invoke in their work. And so, ever since then, my dream is to become an animator!
<br><br>

        As an artist, I have a good expertise in my field. My medium includes paper, pen, colored pencil, watercolor, and acrylic paint. I am not so acquainted with digital art since I was never able to get access to any material growing up. Though, something I do like to share is that I know some basics to 3D Animation. I took a free course after school during my junior year in high school to get myself better acquainted with it. That class had to be one of the best I ever took and I enjoyed ever moment of it, and it made me love animation more. Other than that, I have also designed and painted a school mural and participated in a few art contest. As an artist, you just have to trust the process!
